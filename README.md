### Next.js
Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) React applications. It provides a powerful development experience with features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and static site generation.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. Using TypeScript in a Next.js project enhances code quality and developer experience by providing static type checking, autocompletion, and more robust code.

### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build complex UIs.

### shadcn/ui
shadcn/ui is a user interface component library that offers a variety of pre-built UI components that are customizable and easy to integrate into React applications. It helps in speeding up the development process by providing ready-to-use components.

### Lucide React
Lucide React is an icon library for React applications. It provides a collection of beautiful and customizable SVG icons that can be easily used in any React project.

### Zod
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows you to define schemas for your data and provides type-safe validation and parsing, ensuring that your data conforms to the specified schema.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes. It allows you to build custom designs directly in your HTML by composing these utility classes, resulting in faster development and smaller bundle sizes.

### React Hook Form
React Hook Form is a library that simplifies the process of managing form state in React applications. It provides a set of hooks for handling form validation, submission, and state management, making it easier to build and manage forms in React.
